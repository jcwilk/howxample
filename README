Example code for Howcast! Just an example, folks...

The application is a somewhat contrived Video Flagger which allows you to browse, search, and
flag videos. It keeps track of which videos have been flagged in its local database and could
easily extend to be able to remember notes, comments, or other info that could be stored locally
with the id of the external video.

Most of the project is unfinished, such as the views, most of the model functionality, and the
non-index controller actions, but the specs are in place for the code that is written and the
basics of the remaining functionality is specced out as pending.
